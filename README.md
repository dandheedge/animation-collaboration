# Real Time Animation Collaboration

Mini editor web based app to edit lottie file json properties.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on

your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

1. Install node packages

npm install

2. Add `.env` file

3. Add `VITE_API_KEY="AIzaSyCTumENs4m8cGD6RQ2-zwbGoZpMWOk34KU"`

4. Running the apps

npm run dev

## Built With

- React

- Firebase/firestore

- Zustand

- Apollo

- ShadcnUI

- Lottie React Web

- Vite

## Post Mortem

The project is far from perfect. It covers the following aspects from the assignment:

- [x] Editing JSON file.
- [x] Real time collaboration.
- [x] User authentication system.
- [x] Upload their own lottie files.
- [x] Save the edited files to database.

Time management will improve in the future. I should have spent more time learning about Lottie JSON file structure and schema instead of focusing on creating real-time collaboration using Firebase.
